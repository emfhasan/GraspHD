# GraspHD
Repository containing data and algorithm for enhancing the grasping quality in robotic applications. This project explores the use of neuromorphic data and leverages hyperdimensional computing techniques to improve efficiency and accuracy in robotic grasping.


Concatenating Data Files

The data file has been split into multiple parts to manage the large size. Before using the data, you'll need to concatenate these parts back into the original .tar file.

On Unix/Linux/Mac:
Navigate to the folder containing the data parts.
Run the following command:cat smartGrasping_splittedexps_microSec.tar.part-* > smartGrasping_splittedexps_microSec.tar
This will concatenate all the parts and create the original smartGrasping_splittedexps_microSec.tar file

On Windows:
Download and install a tool capable of file concatenation.
Use the tool to concatenate the data parts into the original .tar file.
